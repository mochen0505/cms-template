    ```

### Run the App ###
 
* Simply run:

    ```Bash
    npm start
    ```
    
* The App will be running on localhost:3000
* Since the App requests APIs from _demo-node-api_, you need to run both of the projects to check out the full flow of this app.
* Or you can simply revise the state _isAuthenticated_ in _App.js_ to look inside. 

### Deployment ###  
 
* To build, run:

  ```Bash
  npm run build
  ```
* Copy the _build_ to the _src_ dic of _demo-node-api_
* The App will be running on localhost:3001
